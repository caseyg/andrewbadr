[**Deconditioning Stickers**](http://www.decostick.cc/) are stickers that look like the notification symbols from Facebook, Instagram, and other apps.

It's crazy how deeply emotionally trained everyone is to tap on those little numbers. By sticking this imagery out of context, Deconditioning Stickers are meant to undermine that training, or at least divert its energy for your amusement.

Initially created for my final project at [SFPC](http://sfpc.io/), I went on to develop the second iteration seen here. About 1,000 sticker sheets were distributed in NYC and around the world.
